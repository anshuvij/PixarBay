What I have done in this project :

1. Not used any third party library.
2. Have followed protocol based approach for easier modification.
3. Suggestion while searching for an image.
4. Used NSCache to store image once it has been viewed, it improves flickering issue.
5. Followed MVP approach.
6. Add swipe feature to swipe between full screen images
